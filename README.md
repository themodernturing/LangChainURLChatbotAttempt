# URL Chatbot Prototype

This repository contains an experimental prototype of a URL chatbot. It leverages LangChain for web content retrieval, Cohere for question answering, and Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface.

## Project Description

This project aims to build a question-answering system that can extract information from a given URL and respond to user queries based on that content. It serves as a learning experience in integrating large language models (LLMs) with web data retrieval and building interactive web applications.

## Technologies Used

* **LangChain:** For document loading and text processing.
* **Cohere:** As the LLM for generating responses.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the web user interface.
* **Unstructured:** For parsing various document formats from URLs.
* **FAISS:** For efficient similarity search and vector storage.
* **Hugging Face Transformers/Sentence Transformers:** For generating text embeddings.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up Cohere API Key:**
    * Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file in your project directory.
    * Add your Cohere API key to the file:
        ```toml
        COHERE_API_KEY = "YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY"
        ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit App:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run URLChatbotExperiment.ipynb # or your notebook filename
    ```

## Usage

1.  Open the Streamlit app in your web browser.
2.  Enter the URL of the webpage you want to query.
3.  Ask a question related to the content of the URL.
4.  The chatbot will generate a response based on the information extracted from the webpage.

## Project Structure

* `URLChatbotExperiment.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
* `requirements.txt`: A list of required Python packages.
* `.streamlit/secrets.toml`: (Should not be committed to Git) Contains the Cohere API key.
* `README.md`: This file.

## Potential Improvements and Known Issues

* This project is a prototype and may have limitations in handling complex web pages or generating accurate responses.
* Error handling can be improved to provide better feedback to the user.
* The system's performance can be optimized for faster response times.
* More robust URL parsing and content extraction techniques can be explored.
* Currently the code has some errors that are being worked on.
